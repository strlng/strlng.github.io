So I had posted this info before but a I took it down since I wasnâ€™t sure if certain people read my website. My big news is I got a new job! Starting Monday December 29 I will be working for the University of Wisconsin National Primate Research Center! I am going to be doing mainly PHP web development in a Unix and Mac environment. How sweet is that you may ask? Well, letâ€™s just say I will officially be sittinâ€™ in butter. Oh yeah. Butter. I am really excited about this. Itâ€™s kind of funny. Sarah and I were talking this morning and we realized that the reason I got this job is mainly due to skills I acquired outside of work. I started coding PHP in my free time and I was the one who got my current employer to start using it for our web sites. My Mac experience is pretty much all on my own time. So itâ€™s kind of cool. Just goes to show, if you want to do something you need to work on it yourself. No one is going to do it for you. A little advice for all you kids who read this site. ðŸ˜‰
