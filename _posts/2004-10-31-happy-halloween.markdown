Well, it’s Halloween. Quite a fun holiday I must say. With 2 kids today was filled with costumes, trick or treating and hyperactivity. Presently I am watching Queen of The Damned. Recommended to me because “it is so terrible it is awesome.” So far I must pleasantly agree. This weekend was a busy one. We painted our living room. Red. The color is really warm and relaxing. Our wireless access point starting dying so we got an Airport Express. Very nice.
