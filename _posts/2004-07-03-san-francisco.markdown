Sarah and I have been in San Francisco for a week now. Iâ€™ve had the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference to keep me busy. Sarah spent a good portion of her free time doing some site seeing, s you can see from some of these pictures. Weâ€™ve had a great time, but we are really excited to get home to the kids. They had a great week with Grandma Anderson so I hope theyâ€™ll be happy to see us. We got them some pretty decent souvenirs so hopefully that will help. ðŸ™‚
