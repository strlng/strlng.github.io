I looked out our patio door on the afternoon of September 28 and saw the pictured here. It was really amazing. After a couple minutes the hawk flew away, but my five year old, Jack, said he saw it swoop down in the yard behind us shortly after. We seem to an abundance of nature in our little yard. The visiting hawk, and my recent Man vs. Wild experience are just two examples. Weâ€™ve had all manner of critters around this year.
