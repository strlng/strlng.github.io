Today was a travel day. I left Edinburgh and travelled to Inverness via rail. As a Wisconite who lived through Scott Walker's teure as governor, riding the train brings about a wistful remembrance about what could have been. Regardless, the train is a great way to travel. I had upgraded my tickets to first class to make it even more fancy so I thoroughly enjoyed it, even considering the woman who was most displeased that there would not be tea service!
