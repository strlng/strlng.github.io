I went to the Capitol the other night and took some pictures to see what what shooting at night would be like. It’s really kind of fun. For next time I think I’ll bring a tripod though. Some of the exposures were long enough that even when propping the camera or leaning on something I ended up with blur.  
Oh, and I have a photo of the giant spider living outside our living room window. Pretty sure it’s hoping to catch one of the cats in it’s web. It’s that big.
