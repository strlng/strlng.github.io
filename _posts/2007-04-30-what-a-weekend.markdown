We took the kids out to practice riding their bikes sans training wheels this weekend. Jack, who just turned five needs some work. He didnâ€™t really seem to be in the zone, and was easily distracted. There were a few times where it seemed he might be balancing okay, but heâ€™s got his work cut out for him. He just turned five though, heâ€™ll have it by the end of the summer. Noah on the other hand, sheâ€™s ready. She will be eight in June. We should have had her up on two wheels two years ago, but she has always been a bit skittish. We were practicing on a basketball court and it took five minutes for her to be up. She doesnâ€™t have the confidence to get started on her own yet, but she can balance and go all on her own now. I had one of those weird parent moments when she first went on her own. I pretty much collapsed it was so wonderful to see. I think Noah and I will be doing more practicing this week. Sheâ€™s pretty excited about the possibility of going for bike rides with dad. So am I. ðŸ™‚ I also changed the oil in the lawn mower this weekend. That wouldnâ€™t be a big deal except I bought the thing in 1998 and this was the first time I had changed the oil. It was black. I think Iâ€™ll change it again half way through the season just to make sure things stay a bit cleaner in there.
