Jack had his Cub Scout Rain Gutter Regatta last night. He had a blast, and can’t wait for next year. Jack’s first race was against the kid who ended up placing first in his den, and he beat Jack. A few minutes later Jack had his second chance and rolled over five kids. In the end Jack placed third. Not that it mattered, Jack was having fun the whole time.
