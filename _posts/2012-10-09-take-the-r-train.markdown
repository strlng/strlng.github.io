This wonderful song asks the viewer to vote Romney/Ryan. It doesnâ€™t get really good until about the 2 minute when out of the blue the artist starts calling President Obama and even former President Clinton gay. Its quite funny until you realize just how disturbing it is.

This Youtube artist has also done the country a service by [pointing out the many phallic symbols at the Denver airport](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOQsvOkkLq4).
