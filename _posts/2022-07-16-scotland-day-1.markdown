I began my trip to Scotland on Friday morning, waking up to catch the 5:30am bus to Chicago O'Hare Airport. I arrived at the airport with plenty of time to check in and get through security, and was looking forward to a somewhat short, two hour wait before the first leg of my trip. Unfortunately Air Canada had different plans. My flight out of O'Hare was nearly two hours later taking off, and upong landing in Toronto we sat waiting to deplane for almost 90 minutes.

I was supposed to have an over seven hour layover in Toronto, but because of delays that was cut to only three. Considering the crowds and activity in Toronto that was a good thing. Luckily my flight out of Toronto was on time, and I even had an empty seat next to. I flew through the night and arrived in Edinburgh around 9am Saturday.

A short tram ride later I met up with Andy and Kim Brei, [who have been galavanting around Canada, Ireland, and England for over a month](https://andybrei.wixsite.com/worldtour). I'm staying with them at their very homey AirBnB in PinPont in the Dumfries and Galloway region of Scotland for my first few days.

It took close to 24 hours to go door to door, so after visiting for a bit in the evening I crashed for almost 12 hours.
