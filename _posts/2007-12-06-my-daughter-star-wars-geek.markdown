I’m such a proud father. Noah is really learning her [Star Wars](http://www.starwars.com/) lore. Last night Saint Nick came and one of the things he left in Noah and Jack’s stockings was a small Star Wars Lego set for each of them. The kids were admiring their Legos and cursing the fact that they had to go to school instead of playing with their new Legos when Noah made a comment about how she wished [banthas](http://www.starwars.com/databank/creature/bantha/) weren’t so gross. Jack asked, “What’s a bantha?” Noah’s reply:

> “You know, [sand people’s](http://www.starwars.com/databank/species/tuskenraider/) pets. They ride them. Usually in single file to hide their numbers.”

That last bit is of course what [Ben Kenobi](http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/obiwankenobi/) told [Luke Skywalker](http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/lukeskywalker/) in [Episode IV](http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/) when they find the destroyed [sandcrawler](http://www.starwars.com/databank/vehicle/sandcrawler/). I ask you, how many eight year old girls know that?
