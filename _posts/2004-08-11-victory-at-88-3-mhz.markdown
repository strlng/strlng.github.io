Huzzah! Finally, after searching and searching I found it. If I tune my crappy ass FM transmitter for my iPod to 88.3 I can get from home to work (and back!) in relatively static free bliss. I don’t know if it’s the crappy transmitter I have or the fact that Madison has so many damn radio stations, but it is a pain in the ass.
