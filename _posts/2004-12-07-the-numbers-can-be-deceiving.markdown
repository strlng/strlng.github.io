Complaints to the FCC about what we watch on television were up to 240,000 in 2003. This is up from roughly 14,000 in 2002, and from fewer than 350 in 2001 and 2000. Wow, Americans are getting fed up with the crap we see on television, right? Not quite. 99.8% of these complaints were files by Parents Television Council. Amazing how if you look even a little deeper the numbers tell a completely different story. Link to the source. Though, I have to say you could get rid of all the crap "reality‚Äù television. It just sucks.
