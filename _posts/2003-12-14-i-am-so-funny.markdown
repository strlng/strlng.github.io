So, we are all sick in the Anderson household. Sarah has actually lost her voice. Over dinner tonight she leaned over the table and said quietly: “Just talking gives me a headache.” My response? “Your talking gives me a headache too!” Luckily, this was one of those times she could tell I was speaking in jest. Apparently it is sometimes hard to tell when I am being funny. Sarah says it is because funny is something I am not. I prefer to think that no one else is able to comprehend my extreme sense of humor. A king of comedy, that is me.
