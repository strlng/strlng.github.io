> In 1970, in New York City, a newly minted teacher at a public school earned about $2,000 less in salary than a starting lawyer at a prominent law firm. These days the lawyer takes home, including bonus, $115,000 more than the teacher

Paying teachers more is not going to solve the education problems in our country, but cutting the educational budgets of school districts certainly is not going to either.

There needs to be a sea change in this country in how we regard our kids’ educators. We need to respect teachers as much as we respect celebrities, and successful businesspeople. When we start respecting the profession, and paying teachers a better salary more “cream of the crop” young people will go in to teaching.
