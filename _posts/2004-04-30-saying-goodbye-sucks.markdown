We found out last night that our very sick cat Frodo has FIP. It’s one of the 3 killer viruses a cat can get. He’s been really sick for almost 2 months now and it has gotten to the point where he does not even want to move. I’m going to take him to the vet this afternoon and have him put to sleep. We had to explain to the kids last night what was happening. Jack had a typically 2 year old response. He didn’t understand at all. Noah on the other hand is not too happy. She’s really bummed. It’s nice that we still have the other cat but that’s really no consolation right now. Before we left this morning we had the kids say goodbye for the last time to Frodo. They handled it pretty well but I think tonight may be rough for them. Frodo has always been a really cool cat. I’m really going to miss him. I’ll post some pictures of him to the web site later today.
