Well, this morning Santa got his ass up at 3:30 am hoping to get his hands on a Nintendo Wii. No luck. Next try will be Sunday morning early it looks like. Best Buy is apparently going to have a bunch then. Santa had the opportunity to order a “bundle” from an online reseller that included an extra controller, some other stuff and several games, but all he wants for the Anderson kids is the Wii and maybe an extra controller. The $800 bundle was just too far over the Christmas budget for the jolly old elf. Santa hopes he can get his hands on a Wii before Christmas. At least he’s not looking for a Playstation 3.
