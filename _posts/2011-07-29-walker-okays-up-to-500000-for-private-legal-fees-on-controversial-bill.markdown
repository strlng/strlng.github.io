> Gov. Scott Walker has agreed to pay a private law firm up to $500,000 for legal services regarding his controversial budget repair bill curbing public employees’ collective bargaining rights, a spokesman for the governor confirmed.

Walker signed the agreement before even unveiling the bill.

The law firm did have a little help getting their foot in the door it seems.

> Signing the contract for Michael Best & Friedrich was attorney Raymond Taffora, a month after he left his job with the state attorney general’s office, which usually represents the state on legal challenges.  
> Werwie said the firm was hired “at the request of the attorney general’s office” to review the budget-repair bill and provide other legal services the office could not.
