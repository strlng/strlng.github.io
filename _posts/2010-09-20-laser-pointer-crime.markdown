You think you are real funny with that laser pointer don’t you? Well chum, watch where you point that thing or you could end up with some jail time and a decent fine.

Wisconsin state statute

> **941.299 Restrictions on the use of laser pointers.**  
> …  
> (2) No person may do any of the following:  
> (a) Intentionally direct a beam of light from a laser pointer at any part of the body of a correctional officer, law enforcement officer, or commission warden without the officer’s consent, if the person knows or has reason to know that the victim is a correc- tional officer, law enforcement officer, or commission warden who is acting in an official capacity.  
> (b) Intentionally and for no legitimate purpose direct a beam of light from a laser pointer at any part of the body of any human being.  
> (c) Intentionally direct a beam of light from a laser pointer in a manner that could reasonably be expected to alarm, intimidate, threaten or terrify another person.  
> (d) Intentionally direct a beam of light from a laser pointer in a manner that, under the circumstances, tends to disrupt any public or private event or create or provoke a disturbance.  
> (3) (a) Whoever violates sub. (2) (a) is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.

In case you were wondering, a Class B misdemeanor may include a fine up to $1,000, or imprisonment for up to 90 days, or both; however, for a repeat offender, the term of imprisonment could increase to up to 2 years.
