Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus released the following statement:

> As I’ve repeatedly stated, this issue is a distraction.&nbsp; Our economy is strained from out of control deficits, debt, and unsustainable entitlements. The President ought to spend his time getting serious about repairing our economy, working with Republicans and focusing on the long term sustainability of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Unfortunately his campaign politics and talk about birth certificates is distracting him from our number one priority – our economy.

Yes, the President just cannot stop talking about his birth certificate it seems.

Perhaps the RNC should require all members to denounce birthirism, and anyone who has ever questioned the President’s place of birth should be kicked out of the Party to show how serious they are.
