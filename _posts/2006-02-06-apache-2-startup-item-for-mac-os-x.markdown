I’ve installed Apache 2.2.0 on a few systems lately so I decided to create a startup item. If you have installed Apache 2 on your Mac and would like to have it start on boot like many other services do, here’s how.

It’s nearly identical to the Apple supplied Apache 1.3 startup item. To give it a try just download the archive and follow the instruction in the README file. You will need some basic understanding of the terminal.
