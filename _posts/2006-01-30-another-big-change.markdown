So, now I just migrated the entire site over to Textpattern. It’s a PHP/MySQL based Content Management System (CMS). Much like all the other "blog” type systems out there. I was really impressed with how Textpattern is built though. It’s got a very robust template system. Pretty much everything is stored in the DB as well. The only drawback their is I need to edit all my code using web based forms, instead of the editor of my choice. So far the positives far outweigh the negatives though. I’ve got the basics of my site in the new system, including a rather sizable change to the CSS of the site. I’m working on a basic photo gallery, another thing Textpatternhandles out of the box. It’s support is pretty rudimentary, but it should work for what I want to do. If you see any bugs , or leave a comment.
