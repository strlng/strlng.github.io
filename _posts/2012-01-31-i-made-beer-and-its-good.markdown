A little over three weeks ago I started my first home brew. I started with a kit from [Wine & Hop Shop](http://www.wineandhop.com/) in Madison. I chose their Badger Dark Ale. With some equipment on loan from my friend Matt I was off!

Here are some pictures from the brewing process:

The beer fermented for one week, then I transferred it to a secondary fermentor. After week in the secondary fermentor I bottle it with the help of my son Jack.

It’s only been 10 days since bottling but I could not wait any longer. Last night I had my first taste. I was really nervous that the beer would not get good enough carbonation. Jack helped film me taking the first taste.
