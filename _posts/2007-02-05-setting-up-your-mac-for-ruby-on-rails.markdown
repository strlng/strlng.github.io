I was going to write up a post with instructions on setting up your Mac for Working with Ruby on Rails because the instructions that the main Ruby on Rails site linked to were kind of long in the tooth and they suggested a web server I didn’t care for. So I had instructions all written up, even had a friend use them when he wanted to try Rails out. Next thing I know the instructions The Ruby on Rails guys link to have been updated. So yeah. I won’t be posting my instructions, go here. [http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx](http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx)
