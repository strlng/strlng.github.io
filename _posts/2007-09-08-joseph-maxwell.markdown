Born at 3:44 PM on August 30, 2007, Joseph Maxwell Anderson is here. We went in at around 10:30 AM. Sarah had been having irregular contractions all night and since she was at 4 cm. already they had us come in to be checked out. After about an hour or so, around noon, she was 5+ cm. according to the midwife, who at that point offered to break her water. Sarah had been really tired and dizzy, to the point where she was was afraid of passing out lately so she just wanted the pregnancy to be over. She accepted. Two hours later, unfortunately not much had happened. Sarah broke down at that point and the midwife did an awesome job of bringing her back from the edge. A little later Sarah got a little shot to help take the edge off the contractions, and it was just what she needed. She was able to pull it out, and shortly after that she was ready to push! I wanted to be as involved as possible, so I got into position to deliver. With help from the midwife, I delivered Joseph at 3:44. It was absolutely amazing. I got to deliver him, and hand him up to his mom. I canâ€™t begin to describe the feeling. I really wish I had done it with the other kids. Of course, we also wish we had gone with midwives for the other kids too. Weâ€™re older and wiser now though. ðŸ™‚
