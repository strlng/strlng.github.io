It’s official, Sarah has a bun in the oven! Not that we really doubted the pregnancy test, nausea, or massive fatigue she’s been experiencing. We went to an ultrasound today, so we got a picture of the little pea sized Anderson. The ultrasound put her due date at September 2nd. Everything looked good so far. As much as can be seen so early anyway, a little blob with a heart rate of 167 bpm. So we’re pretty excited and are looking forward to September!
