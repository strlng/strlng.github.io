On my final full day of siteseeing I took a trip to the Isle of Skye on a cold and rainy day. Even with cloud cover all day it was stunning.

Before heading for Skye we stopped at [Urquhart Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urquhart_Castle), and [Eilean Donan Castle](https://www.eileandonancastle.com).

And of course, more Hairy Cows! They really seem to love thistle!

Portree is a beautiful small town, and I plan on staying there for at least a night on my next visit. The [Portree Hotel](http://theportreehotel.com/) looks great, and I had an amazing potato and leek soup with a glass of ale from Isle of Skye Brewing Company in the attached restaurant. I missed the fish chowder they also had on the menu in my excitement and I’m still bothered by that. Next time for sure. I was able to try Skye’s IPA at another stop when we pulled up to their brewery store.

There were quite a few stops; I’ll let the photos speak for themselves.

As you can see it was a very cloudy and rainy day. While it would have been nice to have a clearer view at times, the clouds were really beautiful too.
