So, Figaro has ring worm. We got back from Sarah’s sister’s Sunday and he had a patch of nasty skin. We did some research online and it appeared to be ring worm. It also appeared that getting rid of it would be an expensive pain in the ass. Sarah took him to the vet yesterday and $180.00 later we have a tiny bottle of medicine for both cats. We also spent the rest of yesterday cleaning the house top to bottom. Damn cats.
