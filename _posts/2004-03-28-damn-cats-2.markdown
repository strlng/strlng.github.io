Frodo has been sick this week. Damn sick. I took him to the vet Tuesday and the vet was thinking he had FIP, which is pretty much a death sentence. He seems to be doing a bit better but damn, he still looks hella bad. I thought I would post a picture of how he is looking. Yeah, pretty scary I know. Seriously though, that is how he looks. His eyes are all messed up. He looks like something out of Pet Semetary.
