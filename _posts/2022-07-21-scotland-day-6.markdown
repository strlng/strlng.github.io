After spending the previous day walking all around Edinburgh I was looking forward to a small group tour of the Highlands including Glencoe and Loch Ness. It was a long day, filled with beautiful scenery. The driver, Mac, was friendly, played excellent music, and had great stories in between stops. Iâ€™ll just let the photos speak for themselves. The Highlands are stunning.
