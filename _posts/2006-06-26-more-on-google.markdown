I’ve been fully using Google for about two weeks now and am quite happy. Gmail is great. Google Calendar is great. I’m also using a Rails application called Tracks for my GTD stuff. When I am sitting in front of a computer it is the perfect solution. The thing is, I actually got my dream phone/PDA, a Palm Treo 700p. It’s a great device. I can’t sync Google Calendar to the Palm calendar app though. Google also does not have an interface for their Calendar that works with the small screen web browser of the Treo. For the time being it looks like I will be using the Palm calendar app and going back to iCal. Tracks works okay in the Palm web browser so I can still use that.

I don’t think I will be missing .Mac at all.
