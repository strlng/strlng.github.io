I finally finished Neuromancer after spending way too much time getting through it. It’s just damn hard to find time to read when you have so much other crap going on. Anyway, the book is awesome. I really like William Gibson’s writing. This is the Cyberpunk book. Though, I think the genre name could scare people off. At least from reading Neuromancer the whole “punk” think just does not really fit. Anyway, I just picked up The Crystal Shard. It’s supposed to be good and I have been meaning to read if for a while. Hopefully I can get through it quicker than Neuromancer.
