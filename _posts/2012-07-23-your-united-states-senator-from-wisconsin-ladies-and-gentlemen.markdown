> Tea party-backed Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) says that the right to own high-capacity ammunitions magazines like the 100-round drum that was used to kill at least a dozen people in Colorado last week is a “basic freedom” that is protected by the U.S. Constitution.

It is amazing to me that the conservative response to gun violence is that we need to make it easier for people to get guns. I saw [this information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) today regarding gun deaths per 100,000 people in different countries. Look at where the United States sits in the list. Embarrassing.
