I finally took Jack fishing at Stewart Lake near Mt. Horeb, WI last Saturday. With three kids it is so easy to get caught up in the needs of all of them that you forget the individuals at times. Getting out with just Jack was something we both needed. We started the day with breakfast at Schubert’s, an old restaurant on the main drag in town.

After breakfast it was off to the lake. Stewart Lake is man made, and was drained a couple years ago so it could be cleaned and restocked. When things started out slow I was a little concerned the fish population wasn’t back yet. We ended up finding a couple nice spots and Jack was get getting bite after bite. I didn’t bring a pole and I’m glad. It was great just helping and watching him.
