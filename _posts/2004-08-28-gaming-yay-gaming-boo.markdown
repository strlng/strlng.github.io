First, the good news. After many years I am going to be playing Dungeons & Dragons again! I’m really quite psyched. I was told the best type of character to create for the campaign I am joining would be a wizard type. So I’ve picked up the latest Player’s Handbook and I am reading up. Again, I am quite excited Now the bad news. We’re spending the weekend at my wife’s sister’s house. That’s not the bad news. Anyway, we were playing Monopoly and I managed to land on Park place with 2 houses. $500. Damn. Next round what do I roll? Snake eyes. Boardwalk. However many houses were on it, it had a $1400 rent. I am now writing this message. Of course, since I lost I had to make popcorn first.
