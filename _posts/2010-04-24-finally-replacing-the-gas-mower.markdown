We’ve debated it for a couple years and this week we finally did it. Today our new Fiskars reel mower was delivered! It’s just me and Joe home today, and the weather isn’t cooperating so I haven’t had a chance to really try it out yet. If the couple of lines Joe and I mowed are any indication though we will be very happy. Even with the wet grass the mower cut perfect. Weighing in at 50 pounds its pretty heavy for a reel mower, but compared to our 10 year old gas mower it is feather light.
