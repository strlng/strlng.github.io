There is a heat wave hitting europe right now so today was a good day to check out the ocean and hopefully catch a decent breeze. We drove down to the small tourist village of Southerness. It was a pretty relaxing day. We ate some lunch at the Paul Jones, a family run bar and restaurant. There was a nice breeze from the water, and we learned the local lighthouse is the second oldest lighthouse in Scotland, built in 1749 and decommissioned in 1936.
