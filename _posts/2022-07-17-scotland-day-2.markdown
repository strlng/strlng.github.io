After my long trip I slept around 12 twelve hours Saturday night. I woke up Sunday morning and enjoyed some coffee and toast before we headed to Glasgow for the day. Andy and I are both fans of a Scottish sitcom called [Still Game](https://www.netflix.com/title/80073432) so we made sure to visit one of the more famous locations from the show, Navid's shop. Unfortunately it was closed Sunday so we just got a couple Photos of the outside as well as Jack and Victor's bench.

After our quick stop we spent a deal of time at Glasgow University, the fourth oldest university in the english speaking world.

While are the university we also spent a little time in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.

On the way back to the house at Penpot we stopped and took in a tiny bit of the scenery, and Kim's driving helped us avoid an forced mutton accidents.
