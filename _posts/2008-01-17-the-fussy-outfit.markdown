Sarah got this outfit in November, and every time Joseph has worn it he gets fussy. Yesterday he was wearing it after not for a long time and he napped poorly and last night he would not go to sleep. Finally, around 8:00 PM Sarah gave him to me and said she needed a break. He wasn’t hungry so he wouldn’t nurse for her, and he would not go to sleep. She said good night to the other kids and when she came back downstairs I had realized Joseph was in The Fussy Outfit. I changed him and ten minutes later he was sleeping. He woke at 2:30 AM. The Fussy Outfit is going away forever.
