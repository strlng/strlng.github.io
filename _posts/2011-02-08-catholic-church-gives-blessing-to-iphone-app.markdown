Here you go Catholics. Canâ€™t quite find the time to make it to confession? [Download this app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/confession-a-roman-catholic/id416019676?mt=8&ls=1) to your iOS device for the low, low price of only $1.99 and find absolution. Apparently the US Catholic Church has the app their seal of approval. You can now sin knowing absolution is only as far away as your iPhone.
