title: President Obama&#039;s birth certificate - nice try!

The White House just released certified long form copies of President Obama’s original, long form birth certificate from the state of Hawaii. They also included all correspondence that took place to acquire the document. Obviously they have all their bases covered and this should stop any sane, logical individual from questioning the President’s birth status any further.

Except, sanity and logic have no place here! Obviously President Obama had friends in Hawaii back in the 1960’s, who made sure a child was born to a woman they could pass off as Obama’s mother at the same time Obama was born in Kenya. It makes perfect sense really. Just look past all the hard facts and the truth is staring you right in the face!
