I’ve moved the web site back to WordPress. I liked Textpattern, but there was just too much not to like I guess. At first the templating system seemed great, but it kind of wore on me after a while.

Archives and a gallery are in place right now. I’ll be adding some more interesting content and hopefully keeping the site more up to date now. Of course, I just ran across a blog system written in Ruby on Rails. Luckily, it seems to be not quite ready for what I want to at this point so I’m not too tempted to do another site switch. Anyway, look for some articles to be posted on Apache, Subversion, and OpenLDAP. As well as hopefully some info on modifying an LDAP record from a PHP web interface in the future.
