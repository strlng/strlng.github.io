Interesting column by Maureen Down about Rod Serling. I’ve always like the Twilight Zone, and it would have been interesting to see Serling’s use of our modern vices in the show.

> Ensorcelled once more by that inimitable, smoke-filled Serling voice, which is reassuring and unnerving at once, I wondered how the ingenious TV writer would have used social media and search engines in his plots. Given the way Serling treated time travel, space odysseys, robots and aliens, the 21st-century technology giants would probably have been ominous in one narrative and benign in another. (Just like in life.)
