Yes, the man responsible for such songs as Peace Train, Father and Son, and Moonshadow is on the Terrorist Watch List. Thatâ€™s what you get for becoming a Muslim I guess. Cat Stevens changed his name to Yusuf Islam when he converted to Islam in 1977. I wonder if Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (formerly known as Lew Alcindor) or Muhammad Ali (formerly Cassius Clay) are on the same list?
