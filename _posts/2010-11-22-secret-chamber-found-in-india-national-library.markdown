Now the home of the India National Library, Belvedere House once house the British Governor General as far back as the 1760â€™s. It is also reportedly haunted. The latest is an approximately 1,000 square foot hidden room with no entrances. I was just found during renovations. No one has gone in yet because they need permission from the Ministry of Culture.

They will probably find some sacred religious stones, a Kali Thuggee cult, and a bunch of child slaves forced to lkook for the the other lost stones. Maybe an archeologist, hist young sidekick, and a lounge singer too.
