I cannot think of any other way to describe it. Here’s the low down: Week ago Friday: Noah has a fever, comes home early from school. Vomits that night. Week ago Saturday: She seems to be doing better, has a great day. Vomits again that night. Week ago Sunday: Seems to be doing a bit better, still has a touch of a fever so we make her take it easy. Week ago today: I stay home from work with her to give her another day of rest. She has a great day. Last Tuesday: Jack comes down with a fever. He vomits a little in the night. Last Wednesday: Sarah keeps Jack home just to be safe. Last Thursday: Jack is still sick, I stay home and let Noah stay home too. Later in the afternoon she ends up getting a high fever again. Last Friday: Noah and Jack stay home with Sarah again. Noah vomits in the morning. Everyone is pretty much okay over the weekend. Kind of wasted from the week so we all take it easy. Now today. I am leaving work in 10 minutes to go get Jack. He has a mild fever. Repent! The end is nigh! The Black Death is upon us! Oh, and I think Frodo (one of the cats) is going to die. he just is not getting well and I swear, his left eyeball is gonna fall out or something. the vet gave me some medicine for him on Saturday and if this doesn’t do anything he said the cat is basically fucked.
